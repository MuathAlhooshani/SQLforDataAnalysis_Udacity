### SQL for Data Analysis
A Udacity course on SQL for data analysis.

### Description
the course which mainly focuses on writing SQL to analyze data and answer questions on an already existing data base i.e. writing queries.
During this course I took notes and solved practice questions and organized them into relevant files.
These files included in this repository are:
Part1_Basics: which goes over the basics of SQL such as the SELECT, FROM, WHERE, ORDERBY and LIMIT statements.
Part2_Joins: in this part we are introduced to the different types of JOINS in SQL and NULL values.
Part3_Aggregations: goes over how aggregations work in SQL with the GROUP BY and HAVING statements.
Part4_Subqueries: this part is about utilizing nested queries, subqueries and CTE's to reach answers to more complex questions efficiently.

### Capstone project
The Sakila Database holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs. In this project, I investigate the database for interesting patterns and run SQL queries and answerer questions about the database as well as build visualizations to showcase the output of the aforementioned queries.
